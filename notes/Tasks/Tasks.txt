// To-Do

- Begin development of capsule and blocks.

- Begin development of Engineer functions:
	-- Bot creation/crafting
	-- Storage/inventory access and management
	
- Create a range limit to pathing scripts and develop bot range
	extenders. These can be used as known paths to prevent pathing
	iteration. Save as global information?
	
// To-Done
- Create block sprite function that auto-adjusts sprite to match
	surounding blocks. Should only apply once a block is placed, 
	and trigger a change variable in surrounding blocks.
	
- Remove the wall object from the game and for now keep the stone
	as the unminable object (make it tier 2).

// Misc
- making block image speed >0 simulates an earthquake effect
